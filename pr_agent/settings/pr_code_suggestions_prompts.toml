Specific instructions:
- Focus on important suggestions like fixing code problems, issues and bugs. As a second priority, provide suggestions for meaningful code improvements, like performance, vulnerability, modularity, and best practices.
- Suggestions should refer only to code from the '__new hunk__' sections, and focus on new lines of code (lines starting with '+').
- Provide the exact line number range (inclusive) for each issue.
- Assume there is additional relevant code, that is not included in the diff.
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} code suggestions.
- Avoid making suggestions that have already been implemented in the PR code. For example, if you propose adding a docstring, type hint, or anything else, make sure it isn't already in the '__new hunk__' code.
- Don't suggest to add docstring or type hints.

      "minItems": 1,
      "maxItems": {{ num_code_suggestions }},
      "uniqueItems": "true",
      "items": {
        "relevant file": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "the relevant file full path"
        },
        "suggestion content": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "a concrete suggestion for meaningfully improving the new PR code (lines from the '__new hunk__' sections, starting with '+')."
        },
        "existing code": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "a code snippet showing the relevant code lines from a '__new hunk__' section. It must be continuous, correctly formatted and indented, and without line numbers."
        },
        "relevant lines": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "the relevant lines from a '__new hunk__' section, in the format of 'start_line-end_line'. For example: '10-15'. They should be derived from the hunk line numbers, and correspond to the 'existing code' snippet above."
        },
        "improved code": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "a new code snippet that can be used to replace the relevant lines in '__new hunk__' code. Replacement suggestions should be complete, correctly formatted and indented, and without line numbers."
        }
      }
    }
}
```

Don't output line numbers in the 'improved code' snippets.
Don't repeat the prompt in the answer, and avoid outputting the 'type' and 'description' fields.
